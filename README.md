### Musical Instruments Montage

This is a montage of pictures containing musical instruments created from inside the virtual world of Second Life.  I have chosen the output created by the smartgrid as it has organised the images very well and produced a great result.

I used the same site to scrape images as I did in the previous part of the assignment. Initially I tried it with the same keyword I used previously but I didn't think that the result was very good. I then modified the collect.sh script so that it would allow me to get results for many keywords instead of just one.

I then tried it out with some different keyword sets to see what color grids and smart grids would be created. This result was created using a keyword set consisting of musical instruments and I am very pleased with the outcome.


### Step by Step Process
1. run collect-from-snapzilla.sh
2. run remove-query-strings.sh
3. manually curated the images downloaded
4. run resize-1.sh
5. run smartgrid.sh
6. run preview.sh
