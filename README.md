### Flickr Festival - Smart Grid

I wanted to do one more test using flickr before deciding which commits will be the three main results and which one will be the final result.

This time I have used the tag festival.  The results are very good however it is quite similar to the results I got from scraping the category 'light effects' from www.publicdomainpictures.net.  I think this one is better though as the quality of the images is better and I was a bit more vigorous in my curation for this result.  

The smart grid turned out great but I like the colour grid better as it looks very good when zoomed out.
