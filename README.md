### Robot Montage

Before deciding what keyword to use for my montage I first looked for a site with interesting images to scrape. I decided I wanted to use images created inside the virtual world of Second Life and found a photo sharing site called Snapzilla.

All the images on this site contained query strings so I had to alter the collect script to allow these images to be downloaded. I also had to add some commands to remove the query strings from the downloaded files as the resize and montage scripts wouldn't work otherwise.

Once I had the scripts working I tried several tests with different keywords to see what the results would be. As a result of my tests I decided to create a robot montage as this keyword produced the most interesting results. So I ran the collect script again and then manually filtered out some of the images before creating my final montage.
