### Flickr Lego Minifigs - Colour Grid

I wasn't very satisfied with the results obtained for the lego animals and minifigures scraped from the brickowl website.  

I still like the idea of using images containing lego so I have now scraped images from the flickr website using the tag 'minifigure'. The images scraped from the flickr website are of higher quality so the results are much better.

I think that the colour grid turned out better than the smart grid. However the groupings have been done mainly by the colour of the backgrounds rather the the minifigs themselves.
