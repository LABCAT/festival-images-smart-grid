### Flickr Lanterns - Smart Grid

I was quite impressed with the quality of images that I got from my initial tests on flickr using the tag 'minifigure' so decided to another test.

This time I have used the tag 'lantern'.  The curation process was quite time consuming as I had over 3000 images.  I felt that there were too many images of jack-o'-lanterns so I removed a lot, aiming to keep only the best. Even after doing this the final montage has a lot of jack-o'-lanterns.

The colour grid turned out very good but I think that the smart grid is more effective.  However I think it suffers a bit from the fact that a lot of the images are all very similar to each other.
