### Lego Minifigs - Smart Grid Test

This is another smart grid test using images scraped from the website http://www.brickowl.com/.

I think the smart grid turned out better than the colour grid.  However because the image is so large the groupings are not very obvious until you start zooming in.  When you zoom in you start to see that it has done a good job of grouping together the similar looking minifigures.

When I compare these tests with the lego animal tests I think that the lego animal grids worked a bit better. This is mainly because the minifigures are similar in appearance to start with.
