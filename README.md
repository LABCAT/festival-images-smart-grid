### Lego Animals - Smart Grid Test

This is a smart grid test using images scraped from the website http://www.brickowl.com/.

It consists of all images on website from the category of animal lego parts. 

I think this has worked much better than the colour as it has organised the images very well.  I decided to perform this test with only minmal manual curation.  It has worked quite well although the final result could be improved by removing the images which are similar to each other.
