### Bright Lights Montage - Colour Grid

This is a beautiful colour grid created from a collection pictures categorized as 'Light Effects' scraped from the website http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/.

I wanted to use a large amount of images so instead of using the search functionality I choose a category and scraped all the images in that category. 

The smart grid and colour grid both turned out very well.  However I think the colour grid turned out a lot better as the colour groupings are very strong and easily visible when fully zoomed out. 

For this montage I changed the dimensions of the resized images to 120X120 as I want to create 1920x1080 desktop backgrounds from the result. Using a size of 120x120 enables me to cut 1920x1080 sections from the montage that will contain a 16x9 set of thumbnails.
